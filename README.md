Welcome to the TFS Test Plan Migration Tool.

This utility allows for the copying of TFS Test artifacts (Test Plan, Test Suites, and Test Cases) to different TFS Projects and/or different TFS Servers (across TFS Server versions).

See the TFS-MTM Test Migration Tool.docx Word document for usage requirements and very basic instructions.
